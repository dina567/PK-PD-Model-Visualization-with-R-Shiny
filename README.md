## PK-PD-Model-Visualization

* Title: PK-PD Model Visualizaiton Shiny App

* Author: Hsiao-Chen Dina Kuo

* Purpose: <br>
1. PK analysis: Visualize observed and predicted plasma concentration–time profiles of different dosing routes
2. PD analysis: Visualize observed and predicted mRNA expression (Effect) to time profiles of different dosing routes

* Date: May 2022

* Reference: <br>
The PK/PD modeling is based on a paper I invovled in:
"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of three oral formulations of curcumin in rats"
published on J Pharmacokinet Pharmacodyn. 2020 Apr; 47(2): 131–144. doi: 10.1007/s10928-020-09675-3

* The raw data were re-modeled and the predicted concentrations and effect were obtained using Phoenix Winnonlin 8.3.3.33

* Sample data sets:<br>
Two sample data files were uploaded (one for PK model and one for PD model visualization)
